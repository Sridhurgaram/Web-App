# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Scalability Notes
### Frontend-Backend Integration

REST API or GraphQL communication

Environment-based API URLs via .env

Axios interceptors for token injection, refresh, and global error handling

State management with Context API or Redux

### Security Enhancements

JWT token validation for protected routes

Password hashing (bcrypt)

Rate limiting and HTTPS

Token expiry & refresh

Input validation & sanitization

### Deployment Strategies

Frontend: Vercel / Netlify

Auto-deploy on GitHub push

CDN for fast delivery

Backend: Heroku / AWS / GCP

Containerized using Docker

Environment-based configuration

Logging & monitoring (e.g., Sentry, CloudWatch)

Database: Cloud-hosted (MongoDB Atlas / AWS RDS) for horizontal scaling

CI/CD Pipelines: Automated testing and deployment

### Modular Project Structure

Splitting frontend components, backend routes, and controllers

Reusable services and helper functions

Clear separation of concerns for easier maintenance

### Deployment

To deploy the app in production:

Frontend:

Run npm run build

Deploy the build/ folder to Vercel or Netlify

Backend:

Deploy backend to Heroku/AWS/GCP

Connect frontend to production backend API
Running the Backend
# Install dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Start development server
node server.js
# or with nodemon for auto-reload
npx nodemon server.js
